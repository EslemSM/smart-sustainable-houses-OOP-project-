🏠 Smart Sustainable Home – Java OOP Project

This project is a Smart Sustainable Home Management System developed in Java, designed to simulate the operation of a modern smart home with a strong focus on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, energy efficiency, and user-based access control.

The system manages multiple rooms and smart devices (lights, air conditioners, security systems, sensors, appliances, etc.), monitors energy production and consumption, and applies automation rules based on time, user roles, and battery level. A JavaFX graphical interface is used to interact with the system in real time.

🔑 Key Features

Object-Oriented Design

Strong use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

Extensible architecture for adding new devices or user roles

Smart Device Management

Unified control of all devices through a common SmartDevice abstraction

Device-specific behavior and energy consumption via method overriding

Energy Management System

Solar energy generation

Battery storage and monitoring

Automatic energy mode switching (HIGH / MEDIUM / ECO)

Automation Engine

Central controller applying time-based and energy-based rules

Examples: turning off lights at night, limiting high-consumption devices when battery is low

User Roles & Security

Role-based access control (Admin, Parent, Child, Guest)

Each user type has different device permissions

Graphical User Interface (JavaFX)

Login system with authentication

Real-time device control and energy monitoring

Dynamic updates using timelines

Custom Exception Handling

Safe device lookup with custom exceptions (DeviceNotFoundException)

🧠 Educational Purpose

This project was developed as an academic OOP application, demonstrating how real-world systems can be modeled using clean and scalable object-oriented design. It is suitable for learning and showcasing:

Java OOP best practices

Design thinking for smart systems

Runtime polymorphism and system automation

🚀 Technologies Used

Java

JavaFX

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

MVC-inspired architecture
